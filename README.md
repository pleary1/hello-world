# hello-world
Learning to code because I have found it enjoyable in the past and a class of mine required it.
I am relearning it all again, but just graduated from Georgia State University 18' B.S. Neuroscience and a minor in Psychology. 
Please feel free to reach out, I know learning in groups helps everyone learn faster.
